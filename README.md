# MachineLearning_Pracs
So Basically this repository will be updated on a daily basis with different projects Lets Learn by Doing 
# Day 1
## Classificaton Problem
we want to predict one of several
options (the species of iris). This is an example of a classification problem. The possi‚Äê
ble outputs (different species of irises) are called classes. Every iris in the dataset
belongs to one of three classes, so this problem is a three-class classification problem.
The desired output for a single data point (an iris) is the species of this flower. For a
particular data point, the species it belongs to is called its label.
So basically the model I mad got an accuracy of 97% which is fairly good 

# Day 2
## Classification Problem
So basically in this simple machine learning project I took a Wiscounsin Breast Cancer dataset
which ispublicly available inkaggle, the data did not need that much data cleaning and if so was very little
just changing somethings here and there , so in this I used the KNeighbors Classifier which is the simplest machine learning algorithm and it was fun as i did it and learnt some few things here and there . in this model my best accuracy was at 95% which is not at all bad, hoping to do some more practice on this before i move to complex machine learning projects.
